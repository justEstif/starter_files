# prisma-supabase


Thought you might be interested. I tried using prisma, and it was pretty easy to use after mongoose.

I watched this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjRs6qAdGfM&t=2854s>
Then made a small rest api for practice. My plan to is use it for my final project.

One of the better options I found for hosting the db is supabase. I haven't tried it yet, but I think I might follow this guide: <https://dev.to/prisma/set-up-a-free-postgresql-database-on-supabase-to-use-with-prisma-3pk6>
